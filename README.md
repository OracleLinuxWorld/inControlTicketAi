# inControlTicketAi
AI based ticket classification. This repository is used for storing code related to a gamification challenge for innovation where a team of people will try to leverage a number of opensource components to build a intelligent support ticket classifier and ticket router. The intention of the challenge is to build a minimal viable product which can be used as the foundation layer for more advanged implementation of such a solution.

The main driver behind the creation of this challenge is to be able to enable companies to build in an onpremise custom solution based upon common components. A number of online SaaS like solutions exists in the market and might be well suited for the majority of customers. In some casessecurity, legal and privacy requirments prevent the use of cloud based solution and require a fully private and isolated system. 

## used components
the below list outlines a number of the prime components used during the research as well as in the realization phase of the minimal viable product.
